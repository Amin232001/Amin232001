### Hi there my name is Mohammed Aminul MustafaðŸ‘‹
I'm currently looking to get into the field of web development.

You will see my profile as of now has two repositories known as **"byb_project"** and **"Amin232001"**.

The byb_project repository is about a python program printing out a msg which has then been chnaged by a commit. The Amin232001 repository is the one your currently viewing.
<!--
**Amin232001/Amin232001** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
